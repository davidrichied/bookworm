In the root folder (where package.json is), run "sudo npm install"

Install Nodemon which watches for changes to the code and restarts the app when changes are made
npm install -g nodemon

Install MongoDB
https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/?_ga=1.50097766.1588771673.1480346854



After installing nodemon, I can run
nodemon app.js -L 
and view it on http://192.168.33.10:4569/
and when I make a change to app.js and save it, nodemon will restart the server

Since I am running in Vagrant, I cannot just run
nodemon-debug app.js
I have to run
node --debug app.js
in one terminal, open up another and run
node-inspector
simultaneously, after which I can view the debugging tool on http://192.168.33.10:8080/?port=5858
and the app itself on http://192.168.33.10:4569/

A session is one visit by one browser to a website. A server can create a session ID when a visitor logs into a site. The server can save info in addition to the session.
Cookies are key/value pairs managed by a browser. Sessions use cookies to keep track of users.
